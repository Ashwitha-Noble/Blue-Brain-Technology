# Blue-Brain-Technology
Blue Brain is solely dedicated to developing a physiological simulation for biomedical applications. That is a machine that can perform the functions of a human brain. To accomplish this, we must upload the human brain into the machine. As a result, a machine can assist a man in thinking and making decisions without exerting any effort. Following the death of the body, the virtual brain will assume the man's role. The reverse engineering process of the human brain is implemented in the virtual brain. Nobody has ever fully comprehended the complexity of the human brain. It is more complicated than any other circuitry on the planet. It is possible by using a supercomputer, with a huge amount of storage capacity, processing power, and an interface between the human brain and the artificial one
